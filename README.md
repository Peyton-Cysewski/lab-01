# Lab 01

This lab was the focus of several days. The goal was to make a page using responsive web design (RWD) that changed based on the shape and size of the screen in which the website is being viewed through. This examples uses `display: grid;` and changes across the breakpoints 767px to 768px and 959px to 960px to simulate the usage on a mobile device, tablet device, and a desktop.
